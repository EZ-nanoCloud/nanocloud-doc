In some cases, it may be preferable to change the name of an application for your users, to display it in a more explicit way or to give the version of the software. As for images, it really is recommended to give them a proper, explicit name.

1. In the Applications tab, click :fa-cog: to access the application's or the image's information (depending on which you want to rename).
2. Rename the application or the image in the provided area. 
3. Click :fa-check: or press enter to validate your change.
