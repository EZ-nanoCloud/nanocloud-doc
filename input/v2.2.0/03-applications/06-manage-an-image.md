In some cases, it may be preferable to change the name of an application for your users, to display it in a more explicit way or to give the version of the software. As for images, it really is recommended to give them a proper, explicit name.

1. Click :fa-pencil: to enter in edition mode.
2. Rename the application or the image in the provided area. 
3. Click :fa-check: to validate your change.

Although the default instances size for all the images is managed in the Configuration tab, you can specifically change the instances size for each image.

To do so, in the Instances size section, you just have to check the size of your choice, between Small, Medium, Large and Very large. Your change is automatically taken into account.
