If a group is no more needed, or if it is easier to create a new one instead of editing an existing one, you can simply delete it.

1. In the Groups tab, click the name of the group you want to delete.
2. Click the **Delete this group** button.
3. Enter the name of the group to confirm its deletion.
4. Click on the **Delete group** button.
